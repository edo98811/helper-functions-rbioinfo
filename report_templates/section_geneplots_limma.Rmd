# Gene plots

Here you can see the expression of some genes of your choice. 

TÏ€here is a section to select the genes that are present from a specific gene set. You need to select the contrast and the GO term that you wish and the genes will be plotted. you can copy and paste the code if you wish to do this plot for more gene sets

```{r genePlots, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# dds <- add_symbols(dds, anns)
contrast <- "group_AT2_vs_ctrl" #or the one you prefer
go_term <- "GO:0071347" # to choose
res_enrichment <- myresuSet$group_AT2_vs_ctrl$topGO_tbl
genes_string <- res_enrichment |> dplyr::filter(GO.ID == go_term) |> dplyr::pull(genes)
genes <- strsplit(genes_string, ",")[[1]]

for (gene in genes) {

  if (gene %in% rowData(dds)$gene_name)
    gene_ensemblID <- as.data.frame(rowData(dds)) |> dplyr::filter(gene_name == gene) |> rownames()
  else {
    cat("Gene not found in the dataset.")
    next
  }

  if (sum(counts(dds)[gene_ensemblID,]) > 0){
    # print(paste0("the following plot is for gene: ", gene))
    print(mosdef::gene_plot(dds, gene_ensemblID, intgroup = "group") + ggtitle(gene))
  }
}

```
