# Number of reads

Let's check the number of assigned reads per sample as a proxy of the sequencing depth in the main dds object.

```{r plot-seq-depth}
myd <- data.frame(
  counts = colSums(counts(dds)),
  sample = colnames(dds))
ggplot(myd, aes(x = sample,weight = counts, fill = sample)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  coord_flip()
```
