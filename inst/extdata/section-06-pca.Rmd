# PCA plots

We can observe the clustering of the mouses which show a similar expression profile in the following pca plot.You can change the the value in the intgroup value to modify the column of the experiment_metadata according how you want to group the samples if you wish.

```{r vst, include = FALSE}
vst <- vst(dds)
```

```{r pca}

message(paste0("possible grouping columns: ", paste(factor_columns, collapse = ", ")))

pca_data <- pcaExplorer::pcaplot(vst, returnData = T, intgroup = "group", ellipse = FALSE, text_labels = FALSE, ntop = 5000)

pcaExplorer::pcaplot(vst, intgroup = "group", ellipse = FALSE, text_labels = TRUE, ntop = 5000)
```

PCA explorer can be used to interactively observe the object, you can also delete single objects and explore how the PCA changes. In the source code at this point there is an example of the chunk that you need to run to start the app. 

```{r pcaExplorer, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
pcaExplorer(
  dds = dds,
  annotation = anns,
)
```
