# helper-functions-rbioinfo

**An R package designed to streamline RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses by simplifying data handling and report generation.**

---

## Introduction

`helper-functions-rbioinfo` is an R package created to facilitate the creation of reproducible reports from RNA-seq or bioinformatics analyses. It helps manage data preprocessing, differential expression analysis results, and enrichment outputs, allowing you to focus on interpretation and report generation without worrying about data management or inconsistencies.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub using the `remotes` package:

```r
# Install remotes if you don't have it
install.packages("remotes")

# Install helper-functions-rbioinfo from GitHub
remotes::install_github("edo98811/helper-functions-rbioinfo")
```

## Usage Overview

The package workflow is centered around a **SummarizedExperiment (SE)** object and includes the following main steps:

### Key Parameters

The following parameters are used throughout the workflow and passed as a list to several main functions:

* `run_computations` (logical): Whether to run the computations or just load precomputed results.
* `analysis_name` (string): Name for the current analysis.
* `source_se` (string): Path to an RDS file containing the starting SummarizedExperiment object.
* `subset_object` (logical): Whether to subset the data object.
* `species` (string): Species identifier (`"hs"` for human, `"mm"` for mouse).
* `metadata_file` (string): Path to metadata in XLSX or CSV format.
* `workflow` (string): Choose from `"se_vdx"`, `"se_dds"`, `"se"`, or `"dds"`.
* `save_results` (logical): Whether to save results after computation.

These parameters are passed as the `params` argument to the following key functions in the package:

* `prepare_workspace`
* `load_results`
* `create_annotations`
* `table_topGO`
* `save_results`

### Workflow Steps

1. **Parameter Validation**
   Check that all required parameters are correctly set.

2. **Workspace Preparation**
   Load essential input data including:

   * `source_se` object
   * Metadata (validated for matching rownames with the SE rowData)

3. **Loading Results**
   If `run_computations` is `FALSE`, load previously computed results for visualization or further analysis.

4. **Data Subsetting** (optional)
   Subset the SE or associated objects if requested.

5. **Annotation Creation**
   Create annotation data frames (`anns`) if they do not already exist in the environment.

6. **Differential Expression Results Handling (`all_the_results`)**
   Generate DE results objects for specific contrasts.
   Currently supports input objects of type `dds` or `limma`.

7. **Differential Expression Table (`table_DE`)**
   Create interactive DE result tables suitable for reports or exploration.
   Designed to be run in a loop across contrasts.

8. **Enrichment Analysis (`topGO` or `clusterProfiler`)**
   Perform GO enrichment on DE results.
   Works with `limma` and `DESeq2` results using the SYMBOL column generated by `all_the_results`.

9. **Saving Results**
   Save:

   * `myresuset` as `results.rds`
   * Workflow-specific objects (`se`, `vdx`, `dds`, `results`) passed in a named list.

## Workflow Concept

The package revolves around a clean, modular workflow using the SummarizedExperiment framework:

* Load core inputs: `metadata`, `anns`, and `se`.
* If `run_computations = FALSE`, load stored results (`deede` and `myresuset`).
* Optionally subset data and create annotations.
* Users perform DE analysis externally based on their preferred workflow.
* Extract results with `all_the_results`.
* Create interactive DE tables via `table_DE`.
* Perform enrichment analysis and generate interactive tables with `table_topGO`.

---

## Goals

* Remove the burden of data wrangling and inconsistency handling.
* Allow users to focus on efficient report creation and data interpretation.
